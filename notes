Once you've created $database/$document, just PUT the contents of the
file you want to attach to
/$database/$document/$attachmentName?rev=$rev, where $rev is the
revision from your newly-created document.  Example:

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5984/test
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/test
(cd jcl
for file in *; do
    rev="$(curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/test/$file -d '{"name":
"'"$file"'", "date": "'"$IDATE"'" }' | sed -ne
's/^.*"rev":"\([^"]*\)".*$/\1/p')"
    curl --data-binary @"$file"  -X PUT
http://localhost:5984/test/$file/contents?rev="$rev"
done)

sending a command plan:
1) make the json command structure
2) send to couch, keep the id
3) long poll for changes to that id
4) print result to screen
